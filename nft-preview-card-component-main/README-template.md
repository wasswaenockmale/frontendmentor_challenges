## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about the flex-box, box-shadow property of CSS and how to use the other custom properties of CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container">Some HTML code I'm proud of</div>
```
```css
.container {
  box-shadow: 0px 2px 10px hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
}
```

### Continued development
I am learning more about the CSS properties and how to apply them to make good designs.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This site helped to learn more about box-shadow and how it can be applied in css.
