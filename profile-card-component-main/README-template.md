## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I have learned how to use the negative margin to make a section overlap some other section. This project also helped me dive into learning how to use the z-index and position properties in CSS.


### Continued development

I want to continue learning about how to use the z-index and position properties to be able to overlap elements of html.
I also want to learn how I can possibly always make my frontend responsive.
